Single use links seem to come up over and over, as do expiring links. I personally have written the code at least twice in the last six months alone. Since I'm most
often working with WordPress these days, and I've been feeling bad about not publishing to my personal Github account lately, I threw this together today, and won't have
to code for them again - [WP Single Use Keys](http://beezee.github.com/WP-single-use-keys.html)
